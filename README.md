## About the Project
Starter Projects that I will be working on to better get experience on Programming  

## Supported Languages
This repository supports implementations in the following languages:

- **Python**: Used for data processing and script execution.
- **JavaScript**: Focused on front-end or back-end web applications.
- **Java**: Utilized for building robust and platform-independent applications.
- **C++**: For performance-critical applications and algorithms.
- **Other Languages**: Add additional languages as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.13
- Node.js and npm (for JavaScript projects)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Any other specific dependencies for your project.

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

Follow the setup instructions for your language of choice:

#### Python
Set up Python enviornment
```bash
py -m venv venv\
venv\Scripts\activate
```
install any libraries
```bash
pip -m install requirements.txt
```

#### JavaScript
```bash
npm install
```

#### Java
Compile the Java files:
```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
```

#### C++
Compile the C++ source files:
```bash
g++ -o output main.cpp
```

## Usage

Provide language-specific instructions for running the project:

#### Python
```bash
python main.py
```

#### JavaScript
```bash
node app.js
```

#### Java
```bash
java -cp bin Main
```

#### C++
```bash
./output
```
